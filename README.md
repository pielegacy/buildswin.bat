# buildswin.bat
Using this .bat file, SwinGame's C# version no longer requires the usage of Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio in order to 
build.

This version only supports .Net Framework 4 however this can easily be changed by editing the location of your .Net directory in the batch file. The `.vscode` folder contains a task runner which adds support for building in Visual Studio Code `Ctrl + Shift + B`
